# Key Actions
- Developed a Python-based pipeline to extract structured data from raw Arabic Telegram messages about male
and female marriage profiles.
- Parsed and converted complex, nested JSON message data into a structured tabular format using pandas,
handling inconsistent formatting.
- Enhanced the datasetâ€™s usability for downstream analysis through:
  - Tokenizing lines, extracting fields, and distinguishing between male and female profiles.
  - Applying extensive manual mapping and rule-based standardization to harmonize Arabic text fields and
    normalize variations in spelling and expression.
- Performed exploratory data analysis on 400+ Arabic marriage profiles using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib
to uncover cultural trends and gender-specific preferences and attributes.
